# Purchasing-Power-of-Salaries-by-State-and-City
A Shiny app that simulates an improved version of the job-hunting process of sites like Indeed.com to account for the real value of jobs due to variations in the local cost of living.

This app uses data from Indeed.com provided as part of Datafest (an annual competition hosted by the American Statistical Association) in 2018, as well as publicly available data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

This app can be accessed remotely by loading the Shiny package and entering the following command into R
runGitHub( "Purchasing-Power-of-Salaries-by-State-and-City", "wholmes105")

Note: this app makes use of the dplyr, shiny, and shinyjs packages
